# Maths Coding Challenge
This challenge is designed to test both your basic programming skills as well as some maths fundamentals in a fun environment.

In this challenge you are given four functions that you need to implement code for. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.

The catch? You're prohbited from using multiplication and division operators within the code. You need to think outside the box about how you would solve those two functions in particular.

You are encouraged to make use of TDD during this challenge, and an initial test has been provided for you.

# Thoughts
While doing this exercise take a moment to also consider assumptions that you make at each point. What impact do these assumptions have on the code? What about the return values?
